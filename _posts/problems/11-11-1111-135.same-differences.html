<p>Given the positive integers, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, <i>n</i>, for which the equation, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> &minus; <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> &minus; <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i>, has exactly two solutions is <i>n</i> = 27:</p>
<p style='text-align:center;'>34<sup>2</sup> &minus; 27<sup>2</sup> &minus; 20<sup>2</sup> = 12<sup>2</sup> &minus; 9<sup>2</sup> &minus; 6<sup>2</sup> = 27</p>
<p>It turns out that <i>n</i> = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.</p>
<p>How many values of <i>n</i> less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?</p>

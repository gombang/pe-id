<p>By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}project/images/p085.gif" alt="" />
</div>
<p>Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.</p>

<p>The binomial coefficient <sup>10</sup>C<sub>3</sub> = 120.<br />
120 = 2<sup>3</sup> &times; 3 &times; 5 = 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; 5, and 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14.<br />
So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of <sup>10</sup>C<sub>3</sub> is 14.
<br /><br />
Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of <sup>20000000</sup>C<sub>15000000</sub>.

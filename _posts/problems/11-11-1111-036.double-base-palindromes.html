<p>The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001<sub>2</sub> (binary), is palindromic in both bases.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.</p>
<p class='info'>(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)</p>

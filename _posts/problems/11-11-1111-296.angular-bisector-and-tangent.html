<p>
Given is an integer sided triangle <var>ABC</var> with <var>BC</var> &le; <var>AC</var> &le; <var>AB</var>.<BR />
<var>k</var> is the angular bisector of angle <var>ACB</var>.<BR /> <var>m</var> is the tangent at <var>C</var> to the circumscribed circle of <var>ABC</var>.<BR /> <var>n</var> is a line parallel to <var>m</var> through <var>B</var>.<BR />
The intersection of <var>n</var> and <var>k</var> is called <var>E</var>.

<div align='center'><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}project/images/p296_bisector.gif" /></div>
<p>
How many triangles <var>ABC</var> with a perimeter not exceeding 100 000 exist such that <var>BE</var> has integral length?

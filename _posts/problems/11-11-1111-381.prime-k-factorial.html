<p>
For a prime p let S(p) = (&sum;(p-k)!) mod(p) for 1 &le; k &le; 5.
</p>
<p>
For example, if p=7,<BR />
(7-1)! + (7-2)! + (7-3)! + (7-4)! + (7-5)! = 6! + 5! + 4! + 3! + 2! = 720+120+24+6+2 = 872.<BR /> 
As 872 mod(7) = 4, S(7) = 4.
</P>
<P>
It can be verified that &sum;S(p) = 480 for 5 &le; p &lt; 100.
</P>
<P>
Find &sum;S(p) for 5 &le; p &lt; 10<sup>8</sup>.
